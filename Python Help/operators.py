# The result is floored meaning it will round to smallest integer
print (43 // 10)

# Modulo will give remainder
print(10 % 2)
print(-28 % 10)  # The remainder is positive if the right-hand operand is positive
print(28 % -10)  # The remainder is negative if the right-hand operand is negative
print(34.4 % 2.5)  # The remainder can be a float
